# Spaceship_Titanic_Model_Building

This is a hackathon dataset on Kaggle. This is a classification problem, where we need to predict if the passenger was transported to alternate dimension. I have worked on the data, performed EDA, built the model using classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM and used boosting techniques like Bagging Regressor, GridSearchCV, Cross Validation, XGB. Finally I predicted the training accuracy prior submission of the file.
